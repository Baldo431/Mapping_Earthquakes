# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

### Background
The Disaster Reporting Network, a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world, would like to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. 

### Goal
Build a map on a website using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. On the map, the magnitude and location of each earthquake will be shown in a popup marker. The diameter of the markers for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing context. Finally, to illustrate the relationship between the location/frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, fault lines will be added to the map.
